### Dataset Info ℹ️

- The dataset contains 100 classes.
- The dataset contains ~128,000 images.
- All images are RGB.

### Dataset Creation 🧑‍💻

The dataset used is a subset of the popular [ImageNet-ILSVRC2012](https://www.image-net.org/) dataset that we chose 100 classes from it. </br>
The classes are chosen by running the EfficientNetV2-S model on all the classes and choosing them based on the error rate (The middle 100 classes were chosen).
> [!TIP]
> You can find the code for the dataset creation in `./Tools`

#### The classes are ⬎
